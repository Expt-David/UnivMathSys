## Motivation of Universal Mathematics System

This document introduces the motivation of Universal Mathematics System.

#### Philosophy of Universal Mathematics System

The Universal Mathematics System is based on the following common ideas

1. Mathematics can be interpreted and constructed via computer language.
2. Computers are more efficient and reliable in academic recognition than academic community.

Next, we present comments for the above ideas in reversed order.

#### The Dusk of Academic Community

For a long time, the academic community takes its essential role in validating academic knowledge. This mechanism worked very well during the early years of Mathematics and Science when their predictions easily (indirectly or directly) verifiable through experiments. However, this system had started to show it shortcomings as these subjects grow more and more theoretical.

Nowadays, mathematical theories (as well as theories that heavily rely on Mathematics) have gone far beyond the reach of experiments, since they become much more abstract and aim more on explanation instead of description. This leaves the academic community as the only entity for recognizing theoretical Mathematics and Science.

Generally speaking, academic community does address its functions very well. Nonetheless, as the theories develop, this mechanism which densely depends on peer review has become more inefficient in recognition as well as more vulnerable to mistakes.

Thus, the Universal Mathematics System seeks for solutions. We attempt to train the computers to understand modern abstract Mathematics so that computers may replace academic community as validity certifier. The program will rapidly go through any Mathematics written in appropriate computer language and throw any logical errors it finds. Also, as a low-level computer implementation, it has almost no chances to make mistakes once compiled. Therefore, we believe that this will be a better selection for academic recognition.

#### The Dawn of Computer Assisted Academics

Computers used to be considered only suitable for numerical calculations. This limitation has been broken after the existence of symbolic computation. Symbolic computation is a milestone in history since it implies that it is possible to train computers to understand the abstract meaning of a symbol. Hence, we further more wonder if abstract mathematical concepts can apply to the same things.

It is important to note that symbolic computation is not sufficient for mathematical theories, since symbolic computation is merely a simulation of formal language. The Mathematics we hope to build here starts from first order logic and has a different construction path from the pure symbolic path.
