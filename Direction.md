# Universal Mathematics System

Universal Mathematics System, or UMS, is an attempt to formulate abstract mathematical theory through computer language.

### Introduction

Mathematics has always been regarded as the most objective subject ever created. However, as it is developing, it looks more and more like a game performed by certain mathematicians. Thus, there comes a question: can mathematics be understood by something else except human being?

Universal Mathematics System intends to give a positive answer to this question by training the computer to understand mathematical theories. As a result, computer can be used to set up a universal criterion for mathematical reasoning, even for those abstract theories.

### Language

Universal Mathematics System utilizes C++ as programming language, since its diverse features provide great convenience for reformulating abstract mathematical logic.

All preliminary concepts in Mathematics are formulated as base classes in C++ language, and all other concepts will be the derived classes. Any inconsistency in mathematical logic will cause exceptions either in compiling or in operating. Therefore, a successful compilation and operation will provide the validity of mathematical theories.
