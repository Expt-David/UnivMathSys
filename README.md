### License

This project, Universal Mathematics System, is licensed under GPL-3.0.

### Principle

The source code contains complex inheritances of classes representing abstract mathematical concepts, which allows mathematical language to be translated into computer language. Contradictions in mathematical language will be identified during the compiling and operating process. Thus, successful compilation and operation can provide logical self-consistency of the system.

### Direction

Makefile is provided for compilation. Run output file to see if any exceptions occur. If not, the validity is confirmed. For more introduction, refer to Direction.md.
