# Universal Mathematics System

Universal Mathematics System, or UMS, is an attempt to formulate abstract mathemtical theory through computer language.

### Introduction 

Mathematics has always been regarded as the most objective subject ever created. However, as the it is developing, it looks more and more like a game performed by certain mathematicians. Thus, there comes a question: can mathematics be understood by something else except human being? 

Universal Mathematics System intends to give a postive answer to this question by training computer to understand the mathematical theory. As a result, computer can be used to set up a universal creterion for mathematical reasoning, even for those absract theories.

### Language

Universal Mathematics System utilizes C++ as programming language, since its object oriented feature provides great convenience for reformulating abstract mathematical logic.

All priliminary concepts in Mathematics are formulated as parent classes in C++ language, and all other concepts will be the derived classes. All inconsistency in mathematical logic will cause error in compiling. Therefore, a successful compilation will provide the validity of mathematical theories.
